# Project Description

Mitrika provides a hardware model that utilizes Raspberry Pi-based IoT sensors to monitor environmental factors such as temperature,
humidity, soil moisture, and soil nutrient levels. It employs machine learning image detection to identify leaf diseases in crops. Using sensor data and machine
learning algorithms, it offers fertilizer recommendations, and fruit freshness predictions, and displays the results in a user-friendly Mobile Application/web
interface "Mitrika‚Äù

DETAILED EXPLANATION OF PROPOSED SOLUTION:

Mitrika is a web-based platform that uses hardware sensor data and employs machine learning and deep
learning algorithms to support farmers in their local language, offering four main features

1. AI-Powered Crop Suitability

   Prediction Soil Data: Collects key nutrients
   and moisture info.

   Location-Based: Factors in
   geographic conditions.

   Prediction:
   Suggests best
   crops via ML.

   Maximizes Yield: Optimizes
   output for farmers.

   Sustainable: Enhances
   resource efficiency

2. Precision Fertilizer

   Optimization:
   Smart Plant Disease Diagnosis
   and Solutions

   Data Input: Farmers enter soil
   data (N, P, K) and target crop.
   ML Analysis: System processes
   data using machine learning.

   Fertilizer Recommendation:
   Suggests optimal fertilizers for
   nutrient balance.

   Maximized Growth: Ensures
   best conditions for crop growth
   and yield.

   Image Upload: Users capture images
   of infected plant leaves.

   Disease Detection: Model identifies
   the disease using image recognition.
   Information: Provides background on
   the identified disease.

   Treatment Suggestions:
   Recommends effective treatment
   methods.
